1.use vpn to access
2.to push even though u have a secrect key just accept "its only for test"
3.if u dont see the deployment changes hard relod or empty cache reload
4.if the gpt is not working update the token
5.Firebase CLI reads .firebaserc to know which project to deploy to(it can contain multiple projects ), and reads firebase.json to know what to deploy.
6.on referesh i used to get the blank page or error page that was because my firebase was directly searching for the /browse page but it was handled by router at index.html/app/js soo rewrite in firebase.json
